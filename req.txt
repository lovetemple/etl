Business Requirements – Test Automation Framework
1. Must Have Requirements

These are mandatory capabilities required for the test automation framework to be considered viable for production use.

1.1 Core Framework & Configuration

The framework must support structured configuration management using environment-specific configuration files.

The framework must allow execution across multiple environments (dev, test, staging).

The framework must follow a modular and extensible architecture to support future integrations.

1.2 Data Platform Integration 

The framework must integrate with Google BigQuery for executing data validation queries.

The framework must support triggering data processing jobs as part of test execution (e.g., Dataflow, Composer).

The framework must support seeding test data into cloud storage and downstream systems.

1.3 Validation & Assertions

The framework must provide reusable data validation assertions, including:

Row count validations

Schema consistency checks

Data consistency between pipeline layers

The framework must support end-to-end pipeline validation from raw ingestion to consumption layer.

1.4 Test Execution & CI/CD

The framework must support automated test execution via CI/CD pipelines.

The framework must provide selective test execution (e.g., stop at a given pipeline layer).

The framework must fail fast and surface clear errors when validations fail.

1.5 Reporting & Observability

The framework must generate structured test execution reports.

The framework must provide visibility into test results and failures suitable for engineering and QA teams.

2. Should Have Requirements

These are important capabilities that significantly improve robustness, usability, and operational confidence.

2.1 Advanced Job Control

The framework should support polling and monitoring of triggered jobs until completion.

The framework should support configurable timeouts for long-running jobs.

The framework should support cancellation of in-flight jobs when tests fail.

2.2 Orchestration Integration

The framework should integrate with workflow orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow / Composer).

The framework should retrieve execution logs and metadata when orchestrated jobs fail.

2.3 Advanced Data Quality Assertions

The framework should support column-level data quality checks, including:

Not-null constraints

Uniqueness constraints

Referential integrity checks

The framework should support negative testing using SQL assertions.

2.4 Test Data Management

The framework should automatically clean up test data after execution.

The framework should ensure test isolation between runs.

3. May Have Requirements

These are nice-to-have capabilities that improve developer experience and long-term scalability.

3.1 Usability & Developer Experience

The framework may provide CLI utilities to scaffold new test cases.

The framework may offer templates and examples for common test patterns.

The framework may include enhanced documentation and API references.

3.2 Reporting & Optimization

The framework may include cost visibility for executed data queries.

The framework may support advanced reporting integrations for historical trend analysis.

3.3 Scalability & Future Enhancements

The framework may support randomized or dynamically generated datasets per test run.

The framework may support additional data platforms or execution engines in the future.
